    "# 4-20 Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these problems is to apply what we have learned in the demo about box-counting dimension to Julia sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we need our approximation to the Julia set we will use. The best choice for this problem is probably the back_iterates of a large radius circle - since this tends to the boundary of the Julia set.\n",
    "\n",
    "        load('SHPChaos.sage')\n",
    "        c = _____ #pick your favorite\n",
    "        n = 10 \n",
    "        starting_points = 20\n",
    "        L = circle_points(radius = 15, num_points = starting_points)\n",
    "        points = back_iterates_n(L, c, n , tolerance = 0.01)[n-1]\n",
    "        list_plot(points)\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. Use the code from the demo to estimate its box dimension: follow the steps that were done in the demo but with this list instead of `sierpinski(10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the fractal dimension change as we vary c? What is the difference in fractal dimension when c is a) inside $M$, b) outside $M$?"
