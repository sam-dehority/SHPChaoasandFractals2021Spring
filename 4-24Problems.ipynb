    "1. Go back through the demo code where we calculated the Lyapunov exponent for the separation of two orbits and pick a different starting point. Do you get a different value for the exponent? \n",
    "2. In this problem we'll see an example of different Lyapunov exponents for a system with an **attracting** perodic trajectory. This example is the [Van der Pol oscilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator). Given by the equations \n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is some constant, take $\\mu = 3$ for example. \n",
    "Here is some code that does similar things to the demo but for this example:\n",

    "3. Now we will see that the Lorenz strange attractor is actually a fractal. We're going to do this using a **Poincare section** (see the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map)). We want to calculate a fractal dimension, but our code only does this for 2d. Luckily we can turn this 3d continous time system into a 2d discrete time system by asking for when the trajectory intersects a given plane. The next time it intersects the plane is the next discrete time in the discrete system:\n",

    "Now do the following: a) define `sol` to be a list giving a trajectory of the Lorenz system using the demo code. (this should be an easy copy and paste. Make sure to use the interesting values of the parameters). b) Use the following to get points on the Poincare section at $z = 25$\n",
